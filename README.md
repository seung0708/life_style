# Life Style

    This is a basic rails app where a user can track the foods they ate for the day. Users can signup by creating an account if they don't already have one either by signing up directly or signing in through Google. Once logged in, a user can create a food into the food database and use foods other users have created. Users can then track what they ate using the foods that they saved or were saved from other users.
